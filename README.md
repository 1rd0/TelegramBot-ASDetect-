## Project Overview

ASD Detection Telegram Bot is a tool designed to help identify Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using artificial intelligence. The bot leverages neural networks to analyze images and other data to predict the likelihood of ASD. It is intended for educational and experimental purposes.

## Features

- **Image Analysis**: Predict ASD based on uploaded photos.
- **AI-Powered**: Utilizes neural networks for high accuracy.
- **Telegram Integration**: Easy to use directly within Telegram.
- **Autism Awareness**: Includes information and resources related to ASD.

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Used for building and training the neural network.
- **Telegram Bot API**: Interface for interacting with Telegram users.
- **Flask**: Web framework for deploying the bot.
- **Docker**: Containerization for easy deployment.

## Installation Guide
# Autism Detection Bot

This project is a Telegram bot designed to classify images as either 'Autism' or 'NonAutism' based on facial features. The bot uses a pre-trained deep learning model for image classification, allowing users to send a photo to the bot and receive a prediction.

## Features

- **Image Classification:** The bot classifies images into two categories: 'Autism' or 'NonAutism'.
- **Simple Commands:** The bot responds to the `/start` and `/help` commands.
- **Automated Image Processing:** Users can send images to the bot, and it will automatically process and classify them.

## Installation

To set up and run the bot locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- [Telegram Bot API Token](https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot)
- TensorFlow
- Python packages: `python-telegram-bot`, `tensorflow`, `numpy`, `Pillow`

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/autism-detection-bot.git
   cd autism-detection-bot

### Instructions:
- Replace `"YOUR-TELEGRAM-BOT-TOKEN"` with your actual Telegram Bot API token.
- Make sure to add a `requirements.txt` file listing all the dependencies.
- You can add more sections like "Contributing," "FAQ," etc., as needed.
